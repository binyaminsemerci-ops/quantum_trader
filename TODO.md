# Quantum Trader â€“ Backlog

This file lists actionable follow-ups now that the repo reflects the demo snapshot. Tasks are grouped
by priority; tick them off or move them to GitHub issues as they are completed.

## High
- [ ] **Secrets & configuration**: introduce a central config layer (e.g. `pydantic-settings`) that
      reads environment variables, removes API keys from SQLite, and masks values in logs/UI.
- [ ] **Dependency hygiene**: pin backend requirements, split runtime vs dev tooling, and document
      optional extras (ccxt, Postgres drivers) without pulling them into default installs.
- [ ] **CI policy**: split fast sanity checks from heavy integration jobs (e.g. ccxt smoke) so
      maintainers can opt in per PR.
- [ ] **Real adapters**: replace mock `/prices` and `/signals` endpoints with real providers (ccxt,
      sentiment feeds) and add unit tests for the exchange factory.
- [ ] **Frontend cleanup**: prune duplicate `.new`, `.bak`, `.tsx` files; ensure components read from
      the updated APIs and handle empty/error states gracefully.

## Medium
- [ ] **Database story**: decide whether to keep SQLite or restore PostgreSQL + Alembic migrations;
      update docs accordingly and add seed data scripts for demos.
- [ ] **Training pipeline**: wire up `ai_engine/feature_engineer.py` + `train_and_save.py`, document
      how to regenerate models, and publish evaluation/backtesting results.
- [ ] **Observability**: add structured logging, metrics (Prometheus/client), and `/health` endpoints
      for k8s/uptime checks.
- [ ] **Documentation refresh**: extend `DEVELOPMENT.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` with full backend &
      frontend setup, pre-commit usage, and stress harness tips (partially done, keep iterating).

## Low
- [ ] **UX polish**: add notifications/toasts for key events (saving settings, executing orders),
      and improve the settings page with masked key previews.
- [ ] **Deployment**: create production Dockerfiles, compose/k8s manifests, and CI jobs that build
      and push container images.
- [ ] **Architecture diagram**: update or redraw the system diagram to reflect the demo-first
      architecture and the planned roadmap.
