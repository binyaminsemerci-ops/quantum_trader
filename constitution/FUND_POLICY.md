# 2. INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY

## 2.1 Core Principles

### Principle 1: Risk-First

> *Risk management is not a feature. It is the foundation.*

Every decision begins with: "What can go wrong?"  
Not: "How much can we make?"

### Principle 2: Exit-Dominant

> *Entry is easy. Exit is art. Survival is strategy.*

The quality of exits determines survival.  
Entry signals are secondary to exit discipline.

### Principle 3: Systematic Only

> *The system trades. Humans observe.*

All trading decisions are algorithmic.  
Human judgment is explicitly excluded from execution.

### Principle 4: No Discretion

> *Discretion is the enemy of discipline.*

There are no "special circumstances."  
Rules apply 100% of the time or they are not rules.

## 2.2 Philosophical Hierarchy

```
SURVIVAL > PROFIT
DISCIPLINE > OPPORTUNITY
EXIT > ENTRY
RISK > RETURN
SYSTEM > HUMAN
```

## 2.3 What This Fund Is NOT

- ❌ A profit-maximization engine
- ❌ A high-frequency scalping system
- ❌ A discretionary trading vehicle
- ❌ A "get rich quick" scheme
- ❌ An AI that "learns to trade"

## 2.4 What This Fund IS

- ✅ A risk-controlled systematic framework
- ✅ A capital preservation system that may generate returns
- ✅ A rule-based execution engine
- ✅ An architecture designed to survive adverse conditions
- ✅ A fund that expects losses and is designed to endure them

---

# 6. EXIT & PROFIT REALIZATION POLICY

## 6.1 Exit Philosophy

> *"Exit is never wrong. Staying in can be fatal."*

The fund prioritizes exits over entries. Every trade must have a predefined exit strategy before entry.

## 6.2 Exit Types & Priority

| Priority | Exit Type | Trigger | Action |
|----------|-----------|---------|--------|
| **1** | Regime Exit | Regime changed since entry | Immediate exit |
| **1** | Capital-Stress Exit | Portfolio stress > threshold | Immediate exit |
| **2** | Time-Based Exit | Time in trade > T_max | Exit within next window |
| **3** | Volatility Exit | Current vol > 2× entry vol | Exit or reduce |
| **4** | Profit-Taking Exit | Target reached | Partial or full exit |

## 6.3 Exit Formulas

### Formula 1: Regime Exit (Priority 1)
```
IF regime_now ≠ regime_at_entry:
    EXIT = IMMEDIATE
```

### Formula 2: Capital-Stress Exit (Priority 1)
```
IF portfolio_stress > stress_threshold:
    EXIT = IMMEDIATE
```

### Formula 3: Time-Based Exit (Priority 2)
```
IF time_in_trade > T_max:
    EXIT = NEXT_WINDOW
```

### Formula 4: Volatility Exit (Priority 3)
```
IF current_vol > (entry_vol × vol_multiplier):
    EXIT = REDUCE_OR_CLOSE
```

### Formula 5: Profit-Taking Exit (Priority 4)
```
IF unrealized_pnl >= target:
    EXIT = PARTIAL_OR_FULL
```

## 6.4 Exit Rules

| Rule | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| Exits are **never blocked** | Grunnlov §11 |
| Multiple exit conditions = earliest wins | Priority-based |
| Partial exits allowed | Min 25% of position |
| Stop-loss is mandatory | Set before entry |
| Trailing stop optional | After profit target 1 |

## 6.5 Stop-Loss Policy

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Initial Stop** | 2% from entry (or 1R) |
| **Max Stop Distance** | 3% (absolute limit) |
| **Stop Type** | Stop-limit preferred, Stop-market backup |
| **Stop Movement** | Only in profit direction |

---

# 7. CAPITAL ALLOCATION POLICY

## 7.1 Position Sizing

| Parameter | Calculation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Risk per trade** | 2% of current equity |
| **Position size** | Risk Amount ÷ Stop Distance |
| **Max position** | 10% of equity (regardless of calculation) |

## 7.2 Leverage Policy

| Scaling Level | Max Leverage | Condition |
|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| Proof Mode | 2x | Initial phase |
| Confirmed Edge | 3x | After 30+ trades, positive expectancy |
| Stable Regime | 4x | Multiple regimes survived |
| Scalable Mode | 5x | Full criteria met |

**Leverage is privilege, not right. It is earned, not assumed.**

## 7.3 Capital Scaling Levels

| Level | Name | Size Multiplier | Requirements |
|-------|------|-----------------|--------------|
| **0** | Proof Mode | 25% | Starting position |
| **1** | Confirmed Edge | 50% | 30+ trades, positive expectancy, no violations |
| **2** | Stable Regime | 75% | Multiple regimes, controlled drawdown |
| **3** | Scalable Mode | 100% | No human intervention, robust to loss series |

## 7.4 Scaling Rules

| Direction | Speed | Trigger |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Scale Up** | SLOW | Criteria met, 30-day observation |
| **Scale Down** | FAST | Any trigger: drawdown, regime uncertainty, edge decay |

> **Cardinal Rule**: Up takes time. Down happens fast.

## 7.5 What Scaling is NOT

- ❌ Doubling size after good week
- ❌ Increasing leverage due to confidence
- ❌ Assuming edge is "proven" quickly
- ❌ Scaling based on euphoria

# 10. APPENDICES

## Appendix A: Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Grunnlov** | Constitutional law that cannot be overridden |

```
Expectancy = (Win Rate × Average Win) + (Loss Rate × Average Loss)

E = (0.45 × 1.6R) + (0.55 × -1.0R)
E = 0.72R - 0.55R
E = 0.17R per trade

Over 100 trades: +17R expected
```
