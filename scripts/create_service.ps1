Attempt to install the CI watcher as a Windows service.

This script does NOT automatically download NSSM. It shows two options:
  1) Use NSSM (recommended): copy nssm.exe to a known location and run nssm install
  2) Use sc.exe to create a service that runs a wrapper CMD (less flexible)

Note: Installing a service requires administrative privileges. Run this script as Administrator.
