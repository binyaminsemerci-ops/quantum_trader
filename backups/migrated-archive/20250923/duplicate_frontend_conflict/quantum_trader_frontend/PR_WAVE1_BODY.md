# PR: feat(frontend): migrate small utilities to TypeScript (wave 1)

This PR performs a conservative migration of a small set of frontend utility files to TypeScript as part of the incremental migration plan.

Files migrated in this wave:

- `frontend/src/utils/api.ts` (replaced `frontend/src/utils/api.js`)
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` (replaced `frontend/src/services/api.js`)
- `frontend/src/services/twitterService.ts` (replaced `frontend/src/services/twitterService.js`)

What I changed
- Added typed implementations for core utility/service modules.
- Removed duplicate JS re-export stubs that caused TS duplicate-export errors.
- Kept `frontend/src/index.js` as a thin JS stub delegating to `index.tsx` to preserve non-TS-aware importers.

Local verification performed
- `npm --prefix frontend run typecheck` — passed
- `npm --prefix frontend run test:frontend` — Vitest: 11 tests passed

Notes for reviewers
- Types are intentionally conservative in this wave (some `any` shapes remain). The goal is compile/time-safe migration, not exhaustive typing.
- No changes to runtime API contracts; these are migration-only changes.

Manual QA (smoke tests)
- Start frontend dev server: `npm --prefix frontend run dev` and visit main pages (Dashboard, Trades, Settings) to ensure no runtime break.
- Run backend tests (optional): `pytest -q backend/tests`

Rollback
- Original `.js` sources are backed up (the generator created `frontend/backups/` entries). To rollback, restore the backed-up file(s) and revert this PR.

Recommended follow-ups
- Wave 2: migrate small presentational components (TradeHistory, TradeForm, SignalsList) and consolidate shared types in `frontend/src/types/`.
