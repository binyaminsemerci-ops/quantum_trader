Title: chore: add agent docs, alembic scaffold, Makefile dev-check, and CI guard

Summary
- Adds repository guidance for AI coding agents, a `Makefile` with a `dev-check` target,
  an Alembic scaffold under `migrations/`, helper scripts in `scripts/`, and an optional CI
  step to run Alembic when `ENABLE_ALEMBIC=true`.

Why
- Improves developer ergonomics (onboarding, local checks) and prepares the repo for database
  migrations. The Alembic step is disabled by default so CI remains stable.

Important notes
- During development a local virtualenv (`.venv/`) containing large binary blobs (for example
  `xgboost.dll`) was accidentally committed and pushed. `.venv/` has been added to `.gitignore`
  and removed from the index, but the large blobs still exist in the remote history. A
  safe history-rewrite plan is included in `HISTORY_REWRITE_PLAN.md` and should be followed
  if you decide to purge the blobs.

Files changed (high-level)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — repo-specific AI agent guidance (new/updated).
- `AGENT.md` — merged agent guidance (new).
- `Makefile` — `dev-check`, lint, typecheck, test helper targets (new).
- `migrations/` — Alembic scaffold (`alembic.ini`, `env.py`, `versions/0001_initial.py`) (new).
- `scripts/` — helper scripts to create/revision/run Alembic (new).
- `.gitignore` — added `.venv/` (updated).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — small guarded change to optionally install Alembic (updated).

Checklist
- [ ] Review `migrations/versions/0001_initial.py` and any autogenerated migration files before applying.
- [ ] Confirm `backend/requirements.txt` vs `backend/requirements-dev.txt` separation.
- [ ] Run tests and linters locally and resolve failures.
- [ ] Decide whether to purge large `.venv` blobs from remote history and coordinate the rewrite.
- [ ] If migrations are accepted, enable `ENABLE_ALEMBIC=true` in CI or add a targeted migration job.

Suggested reviewers: backend maintainers, CI owner, DB owner.

PR note for reviewers
- This PR adds agent docs + migration scaffold and untracked `.venv`. Remote history still contains
  large `.venv` files; see `HISTORY_REWRITE_PLAN.md` for cleanup options. I can run the history-rewrite
  if maintainers authorize and coordinate the force-push.
