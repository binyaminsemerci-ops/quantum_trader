PR Title: chore(frontend): migrate small wave to TypeScript (Toast, StatsCard, BalanceCard, pages)

Summary

This PR continues the incremental migration of the frontend from .jsx to TypeScript (.tsx). It's focused on a small, safe wave with the following goals:

- Add typed components and hooks while preserving runtime behavior and keeping PRs reviewable.
- Keep original .jsx sources as backups (.jsx.bak) and replace them with tiny re-export stubs so imports keep working during migration.
- Run local typechecks and smoke tests before pushing to origin.

What changed (high-level)

- Added/updated typed components and hooks:
  - `frontend/src/components/Toast.tsx` (typed)
  - `frontend/src/components/StatsCard.tsx` (typed)
  - `frontend/src/components/BalanceCard.tsx` (typed)
  - `frontend/src/components/ApiTest.tsx` (typed)
  - `frontend/src/hooks/useAutoRefresh.ts` (typed)
- Pages:
  - `frontend/src/pages/Backtest.tsx` (new)
  - `frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx` (new)
  - Original `.jsx` files for these pages are preserved as `.jsx.bak` and replaced with re-export stubs where applicable.
- Updated `frontend/src/components/RiskMonitor.tsx` to use sample data and a small trade history UI.
- Kept other converted components and charts from previous waves (Chart, ChartView) in TSX.
 - Added `frontend/src/utils/position.ts` with a small position-size calculator and unit tests.
 - ChartView now fetches trades and chart data from the backend when available; falls back to sample data.

Notes & Trade-offs

- Temporary, small use of `any` around some third-party libs (eg. Recharts) to keep waves small and unblock CI — will tighten in follow-ups.
- Backups: All original `.jsx` files are preserved as `.jsx.bak` so rollback is trivial.
- This PR intentionally keeps changes small and conservative to ease review.

How to test locally

- Install deps and run the dev server:

  npm install
  npm run dev

- Run typecheck and tests (already run locally in this wave):

  npm run typecheck
  npm test

Files of note (partial)

- frontend/src/components/{Toast,StatsCard,BalanceCard,ApiTest}.tsx
- frontend/src/hooks/useAutoRefresh.ts
- frontend/src/pages/{Backtest,Settings}.tsx
- frontend/src/components/RiskMonitor.tsx

CI

- Please run the existing frontend CI workflow (tsc + vitest). If any failing type errors appear, I can iterate in small follow-ups.

Next steps

- Tighten API types (replace remaining any casts) — I'll start by deriving `ApiResponse<T>` and `Balance` types from the backend and update `BalanceCard` and `ApiTest`.
 - Added a Vitest unit test for the position-size util (frontend/src/utils/position.test.ts). Please run `npm run test:frontend` to execute tests.
- Continue converting small components/hooks in waves, preserving backups and re-export stubs.

Reviewer notes

- This is intentionally conservative: expect minimal runtime behavior changes. Focus review on TypeScript correctness and ensuring no unintended runtime regressions.
