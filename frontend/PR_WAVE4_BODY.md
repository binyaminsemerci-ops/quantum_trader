Summary

This PR finishes the conservative frontend migration from `.jsx` → `.tsx` for a large set of components and pages. Work was split into many small, reviewable commits and validated after each batch.

What changed

- Archived original `.jsx` sources under `frontend/backups/jsx-bak/` (full original files preserved).
- Converted many components/pages to TypeScript and flipped re-export stubs to active re-exports so the app uses the migrated `.tsx` files.
- Key converted items: Chart, CandlesChart, EquityChart, ChartView, TradeTable, RiskMonitor, BalanceCard, Header, Sidebar, Backtest, Dashboard, Trades, Settings and several supporting components.
- Typed helpers: `frontend/src/utils/api.ts` (typed request helpers), `frontend/src/utils/position.ts` with unit tests.

Validation performed

- Type check: `npm run typecheck` (tsc --noEmit) — no errors in this workspace run.
- Unit tests: `npm run test:frontend` (Vitest) — tests passed in this workspace run (2 test files, 4 tests).
- Dev server smoke test: Vite dev server started and routes `/`, `/trades`, `/settings`, `/backtest` returned the SPA shell (HTTP 200 + root HTML).

Why this approach

- Preserve rollback: backups keep the original code for quick review/rollback.
- Small, safe commits: each batch was verified so the repo stayed green during the migration.

How to review / run locally

1. Checkout the branch: `git fetch && git checkout feat/frontend/migrate-wave4`
2. Install dependencies and run dev server:

   npm ci
   npm run dev -- --port 3001

3. Run typecheck and tests:

   npm run typecheck
   npm run test:frontend

Follow-ups (suggested)

- Remove `frontend/backups/jsx-bak/` in a follow-up PR once this migration has been reviewed and QA'ed.
- Tighten remaining `any` types and add small integration smoke tests (headless browser) for the SPA shell.

Notes

- The migration intentionally kept some files as commented re-export stubs during the earlier steps; most are now active re-exports and the app runs on the migrated TSX files.
- If you prefer I can open a draft PR for you (web UI) or provide the exact `gh pr create` command to run locally.
