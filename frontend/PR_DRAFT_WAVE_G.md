# PR draft: ts-migration — Wave F & G

Summary
-------
This PR continues the conservative TypeScript migration of the frontend. It focuses on small, safe changes that progressively tighten typing while preserving runtime behavior.

What this PR includes (high level)
- Wave F: Hardened shared helpers and hooks
  - `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`: reduced `any` usage, replaced `catch (err: any)` with `catch (err: unknown)`, added small input/result types
  - `frontend/src/hooks/useAutoRefresh.tsx`: extracted and centralized fallback parsing logic; added runtime guards
  - `frontend/src/lib/parseFallback.ts`: parsing helpers (tested)
  - `frontend/src/components/dashboard/SentimentPanel.tsx`: typed axios responses and safer array checks
  - Tests: `frontend/src/__tests__/parseFallback.test.ts`

- Wave G: Service adapter typing (initial pass)
  - `frontend/src/services/api.ts`: added `Signal` and `Sentiment` types; tightened return shapes of `fetchTradingSignals` and `fetchSentimentData`
  - `frontend/src/services/twitterService.ts`: safer error handling (catch unknown)

Validation performed
--------------------
- TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit` (frontend) — no blocking errors for edited files in this session
- Unit tests: `npm run test:frontend` (Vitest) — 3 test files, 7 tests — all passing in this session

Notes for reviewers
-------------------
- Changes are intentionally small and additive. Where runtime shapes were uncertain I added conservative runtime guards and default values to keep behavior stable.
- Many files still use `any` in unrelated areas; this PR targets hotspots that unblock downstream component typing.
- I kept one-line JS re-export stubs where needed to avoid breaking existing imports during the migration.

Next steps
----------
- Continue Wave G: add stronger domain types to the remaining service adapters and update callers in batches of 3–5 files.
- Add more unit tests for `lib/api.ts` helper behaviors (e.g., malformed payloads) before opening the PR.
- Prepare the PR description, reviewer checklist, and attach headless screenshots from `artifacts/`.
