# Draft PR: Frontend TypeScript Full Migration (ts-migration)

Summary
-------
This PR completes the conservative, incremental TypeScript migration of the frontend. Changes were applied wave-by-wave (A → H → I) and focused on small, reversible edits, canonical typed adapters, and thin JS compatibility stubs where necessary.

What changed
------------
- Converted runtime implementations to .ts/.tsx where applicable.
- Left thin one-line .js/.jsx re-export stubs to preserve existing non-TS build/runtime imports.
- Consolidated duplicate API modules into canonical typed adapters: `frontend/src/services/api.ts` and `frontend/src/utils/api.ts`.
- Hardened error handling: replaced `catch (err: any)` with `catch (err: unknown)` and added runtime guards where needed.
- Added `frontend/src/lib/parseFallback.ts` and unit tests to safely parse fallback REST payloads.
- Tightened types across UI components that consume services (PriceChart, OHLCVChart, SignalsList, SentimentPanel, TradeHistory, AIPredict, TweetsFeed, NewsFeed, TradeForm and related hooks/providers).
- Added small Windows helper for dependency installs in CI-like environments (HUSKY bypass during npm ci when .git is absent).

Files of interest (high level)
-----------------------------
- frontend/src/services/api.ts — canonical typed service adapter (fetchPriceData, fetchTradingSignals, fetchSentimentData)
- frontend/src/utils/api.ts — typed request helpers and domain shims
- frontend/src/lib/parseFallback.ts — parsing helpers for fallback REST polling
- frontend/src/__tests__/parseFallback.test.ts — unit tests for parsing helpers
- frontend/src/components/**/*.tsx — migrated UI components; corresponding .jsx files are thin re-exports
- frontend/src/*.jsx and *.js — intentionally thin re-exports to .tsx/.ts

Validation performed
-------------------
- TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit` ran against `frontend` with no blocking errors.
- Tests: `npm --prefix frontend run test:frontend` (Vitest) — 3 test files, 7 tests passed in this environment.
- Dependency install: `npm ci --prefix frontend` was executed with HUSKY=0 in this environment to avoid prepare script failing without .git; documented in the PR.

Reviewer checklist
------------------
- [ ] Spot-check key service adapter signatures (return types and error shapes).
- [ ] Confirm the thin JS re-export stubs are acceptable and won't break third-party tooling in your CI (they only re-export .ts/.tsx modules).
- [ ] Review `parseFallback.ts` for edge-case handling of malformed REST payloads.
- [ ] Run the full app locally (dev server) to smoke-test runtime visuals (Vite dev server).
- [ ] Confirm no functional regressions in charts and trading forms (quick manual checks).
- [ ] Approve tests and TypeScript checks in CI before merging.

Notes and follow-ups
--------------------
- There are still a few backup/restored copies (e.g., `App.restored.tsx`) — these are preserved for safety and can be removed in a follow-up cleanup.
- Consider adding more unit tests around `utils/api.ts` error handling and the service adapters.
- After merge, run a branch-level build and the E2E smoke tests (if available) in CI to validate runtime behavior across environments.

Artifacts
---------
- Headless test screenshots and logs can be attached from the pipeline (this environment captured local vitest output). See `frontend/test-results/` if CI produces artifacts.

Merge plan
----------
1. Open this branch as a Draft PR for review.
2. Address reviewer comments (if any) in small follow-up commits.
3. Merge to `main` (or chosen target) after CI green.
