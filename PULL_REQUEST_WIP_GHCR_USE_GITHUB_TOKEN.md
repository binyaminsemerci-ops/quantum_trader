Title: Switch GHCR publish workflow to use GITHUB_TOKEN

Summary:
- This branch updates `.github/workflows/docker-publish-3.yml` to grant `packages: write` permission and to log into GHCR using the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` instead of an org PAT.

Why:
- Using `GITHUB_TOKEN` avoids storing long-lived PATs and is the recommended approach for CI publishing.

Prerequisite for merge (action required by org admin):
1. Go to the Organization settings -> Actions -> Policies (or "Actions settings" depending on UI).
2. Allow GitHub Actions to create packages for the organization or permit workflows to create organization packages using the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
   - The specific setting is typically named: "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve packages" or similar.
3. Optionally, review and approve the workflow run for this repo if your org enforces workflow approval for first-time contributors.

Notes:
- If the org policy remains set to block package creation via GITHUB_TOKEN, the workflow will fail with an authorization error similar to:
  "denied: installation not allowed to Create organization package"
- If you prefer, you can temporarily keep using the org PAT in the `GHCR_PAT_ORG` secret; this PR intends to switch back to GITHUB_TOKEN once org settings allow it.

How to test after org change:
1. Merge this PR after the org admin flips the policy.
2. Trigger the workflow (push or manual) and verify the image is published to `ghcr.io/<org>/quantum_trader`.
