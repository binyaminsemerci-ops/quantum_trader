## 2025-09-23 â€” Frontend TypeScript migration cleanup

- Archived legacy frontend backups into `backups/migrated-archive/20250923` (non-destructive).
- Replaced archived `index.jsx` with a conservative re-export stub (backup kept as `index.jsx.bak`).
- Added TypeScript generator `scripts/generate-reexports.ts` and usage README.
- Moved tracked `.bak` files into `backups/migrated-archive/20250923/baks/` and removed them from their original tracked locations (PR #19).
- Updated `.gitignore` to ignore Vite artifacts and untracked build outputs; untracked build artifacts (PR #18).
- Verified locally: `tsc --noEmit`, `vite build`, and `vitest --run` all passed.

See PRs: #17 (migration prep), #18 (cleanup build artifacts), #19 (archive .bak files)
