### Task

Design and implement the module: **[MODULE NAME]**.

### Role in the system

[Short description in your own words – what this module does, how it interacts with other modules, and why it is important in the overall Quantum Trader architecture.]

### Responsibilities / Requirements

- [Bullet list of what it must do]
- [What inputs it receives]
- [What outputs it should produce]
- [How often it runs: per trade / periodic batch / event-driven]
- [Which other services it talks to: e.g. PolicyStore, StrategyRepository, MetricsRepository, etc.]

### Interfaces

I expect something like:

- A main service class: `ClassName`
- Repository interfaces: `[Name]Repository` with methods:
  - `...`
- Public methods:
  - `...`

### Implementation details

- Use Python 3.11, type hints, docstrings.
- Keep it framework-agnostic.
- Prefer dependency injection for repositories and external clients.
- Show example usage in a short code snippet or simple test.

Now:
1. Restate the module’s role in your own words.
2. Propose and refine class/method interfaces.
3. Implement the module code.
4. Provide an example of how it would be instantiated and used in the existing system.
