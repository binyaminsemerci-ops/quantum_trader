# NOTE: SQLAlchemy-Utils was previously pinned here for investigation of PyUp
# advisory 42194. A scan of the codebase showed no direct usage of
# SQLAlchemy-Utils APIs (EncryptedType etc.), so we remove the pin and allow
# the project to avoid installing it unless explicitly required by developers.
# If dev tooling needs it, add it to backend/requirements-dev.txt instead.
