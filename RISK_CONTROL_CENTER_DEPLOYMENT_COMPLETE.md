**Universe Status:**
- Universe Size: 218 symbols analyzed
- Cumulative R: 0.00 (no trades yet)
- Rolling Winrate: 0.0% (no trades yet)
- Drawdown: 0.00 (no trades yet)

**Symbol Classifications:**

## 🎯 WHAT THIS DOES

### Real-time Monitoring
- Monitors universe health (PnL, winrate, drawdown)
- Tracks 30+ metrics per symbol
- Computes aggregate performance metrics
- Identifies trends and anomalies

### Intelligent Classification
- Classifies symbols into 4 tiers (CORE/EXPANSION/CONDITIONAL/BLACKLIST)
- Evaluates 30+ metrics per symbol
- Computes stability, quality, and toxicity scores
- Provides actionable recommendations

### Emergency Protection
- Detects cost explosions (slippage/spread spikes)
- Identifies toxic symbols (poor performance)
- Monitors for severe drawdowns
- Triggers graduated emergency responses

### Universe Optimization
- Generates 3 dynamic profiles (SAFE/AGGRESSIVE/EXPERIMENTAL)
- Optimizes symbol selection by risk level
- Balances performance vs. stability
- Adapts to changing market conditions

### Orchestrator Integration
- Provides risk profile recommendations
- Updates disallowed symbols list
- Triggers emergency overrides
- Enables seamless risk management
