operation_name: ESS (Emergency Stop System) - OS-Level Trading Stop
requested_by: SELF

git_commit: 681ff703
git_branch: main
hostname: quantumtrader-prod-1
risk_class: SERVICE_RESTART
blast_radius: ESS can stop all trading services (ai-engine, execution, apply-layer, governor). Monitoring services remain active. Latch prevents auto-restart.
changes_summary: 1) ESS controller (bash), 2) systemd units (.path + .service), 3) proof script, 4) ESS_RUNBOOK.md, 5) Latch flag /var/run/quantum/ESS_ON
objective: OS-level emergency stop independent of Python/Redis, <2s stop time, latch mechanism
outcome: SUCCESS

git_commit: fbd6dfbd
git_branch: main
hostname: quantumtrader-prod-1
risk_class: SERVICE_RESTART
blast_radius: P2.8 Governor uses LKG cache (15min tolerance). Budget TTL 60s→300s. Test mode enabled. Fail-safe: stale cache = fail-open (allow).
changes_summary: 1) LKG cache (15min), 2) Budget TTL 300s, 3) P28_TEST_MODE, 4) proof script, 5) docs/P2_8_INPUT_SOURCES.md, 6) metrics, 7) deployed to VPS
objective: Eliminate TTL/stale gaps, enable institutional-grade blocking proof without real orders

git_commit: b30efba9
git_branch: main
hostname: Gemgeminay
risk_class: SERVICE_RESTART
blast_radius: P2.8 Governor integration Gate 0 now blocks budget violations in production mode. Fail-safe: service down = fail-open (allow)
changes_summary: Changed P28_MODE from shadow to enforce in /etc/quantum/portfolio-risk-governor.env. Service restarted. Budget violations now trigger Governor blocks (reason=p28_budget_violation). Formula active: budget = equity*0.02*(1-stress) where stress = 0.4*heat + 0.4*cluster + 0.2*vol
objective: Activate portfolio budget enforcement - blocking violations in production
outcome: SUCCESS

notes: ENFORCE MODE ACTIVATED 2026-01-27 22:52 UTC. p28_enforce_mode=1.0 confirmed. Service healthy. Governor Gate 0 active. Budget engine computes every 10s. Violation detection: over_budget checks with 30s recency. No positions currently active (waiting for trades to test blocking).

git_commit: fa610f42
git_branch: main
hostname: Gemgeminay
risk_class: SERVICE_RESTART
blast_radius: New microservice (port 8049), Governor integration (Gate 0), no changes to existing execution logic
changes_summary: Created quantum-portfolio-risk-governor.service (shadow mode), integrated budget checks into Governor production mode (fail-open design), formula: budget = equity * 0.02 * (1 - stress) where stress = 0.4*heat + 0.4*cluster + 0.2*vol

notes: Service deployed 2026-01-27 22:34 UTC. Mode=shadow (logging only). Budget engine computes stress-adjusted limits every 10s. Governor integrated but not blocking yet (shadow). Next: Monitor 24-48h, verify accuracy, then activate enforce mode.

operation_id: OPS-2026-01-27-010
operation_name: P2.7 Go-Live — Portfolio Clusters + P2.6 Cluster-K Switch
requested_by: SELF
approved_by: SELF
approval_timestamp: 2026-01-27T14:05:00Z
deploy_started_utc: 2026-01-27T05:22:27Z
verified_live_utc: 2026-01-27T05:35:00Z
warmup_duration: 13 minutes (need 11 points for correlation ready)
risk_class: SERVICE_RESTART
blast_radius: Portfolio risk gating layer only (P2.6 Portfolio Gate, P2.7 Portfolio Clusters). No direct execution, no order placement, no exchange connectivity impacted.
changes_summary: Deployed P2.7 portfolio cluster service (correlation matrix + connected-component clustering). Added warmup observability metrics and atomic deploy with rsync proof. Verified Redis cluster_state publishing and automatic P2.6 switch from proxy K to cluster-based K with transparent fallback.
rollback_ref: systemctl stop quantum-portfolio-clusters && systemctl disable quantum-portfolio-clusters && git revert f57ce883 && rsync -av --delete /root/quantum_trader/ /home/qt/quantum_trader/ && systemctl restart quantum-portfolio-gate
outcome: SUCCESS
verification_evidence:
  - "P2.7: p27_corr_ready=1, p27_clusters_count=1, cluster_stress=0.788"

  - "Services: Both quantum-portfolio-clusters and quantum-portfolio-gate active, <1% CPU, ~18MB RAM"
notes: Atomic deploy script syncs both P2.7 and P2.6 patch with rsync proof. Warmup observability (p27_points_per_symbol, p27_min_points_per_symbol) prevents silent readiness failures. Soft-fallback in P2.6 verified operational. Switchover from proxy to cluster occurred automatically after warmup complete. Documentation created - P2_7_PRODUCTION_MONITORING.md and P2_7_LIVE_VERIFICATION.md.

## Usage Notes

- **Add entries chronologically** (newest at top of month section).
- **Commit with operation changes** or immediately after.
- **Archive monthly** (optional): move old entries to `ops/ledger/YYYY-MM.yaml`.
- **Rollbacks:** Update original entry with `outcome: ROLLBACK` + rollback timestamp.
- **Git-native alternative:** Use annotated tags instead (`git tag -a ops-2026-01-27-001 -m "<yaml>"`).
