risk_class: SERVICE_RESTART
blast_radius: capital-allocation service (new), no existing service affected
changes_summary: New microservice: quantum-capital-allocation.service at port 8059 (shadow mode). Reads P2.8 budgets, portfolio state, cluster stress, regime state. Computes allocation targets with safety caps (40% per symbol, 60% per cluster). Streams decisions to quantum:stream:allocation.decision. Proof: PASS 28/28 tests, <50ms cycle time, 11 symbols processed.
objective: Deploy intelligent capital allocation layer between P2.8 and Governor with regime/cluster/drawdown-aware budget distribution
outcome: SUCCESS

notes: Shadow mode active (no trading impact). Ready for enforce mode activation after 24-48h monitoring. Allocation formula: base × regime_factor × cluster_factor × drawdown_factor × performance_factor. Currently: regime=UNKNOWN (fallback 1.0), drawdown_zone=LOW (factor 1.0), no cluster stress data (factor 1.0), so target=base_budget=.93 per symbol.

changes_summary: Changed P28_MODE from shadow to enforce in /etc/quantum/portfolio-risk-governor.env. Service restarted. Budget violations now trigger Governor blocks (reason=p28_budget_violation). Formula active: budget = equity*0.02*(1-stress) where stress = 0.4*heat + 0.4*cluster + 0.2*vol

risk_class: SERVICE_RESTART
blast_radius: Portfolio risk gating layer only (P2.6 Portfolio Gate, P2.7 Portfolio Clusters). No direct execution, no order placement, no exchange connectivity impacted.
changes_summary: Deployed P2.7 portfolio cluster service (correlation matrix + connected-component clustering). Added warmup observability metrics and atomic deploy with rsync proof. Verified Redis cluster_state publishing and automatic P2.6 switch from proxy K to cluster-based K with transparent fallback.

notes: Atomic deploy script syncs both P2.7 and P2.6 patch with rsync proof. Warmup observability (p27_points_per_symbol, p27_min_points_per_symbol) prevents silent readiness failures. Soft-fallback in P2.6 verified operational. Switchover from proxy to cluster occurred automatically after warmup complete.

## Usage Notes

- **Add entries chronologically** (newest at top of month section).
- **Commit with operation changes** or immediately after.
- **Archive monthly** (optional): move old entries to `ops/ledger/YYYY-MM.yaml`.
- **Rollbacks:** Update original entry with `outcome: ROLLBACK` + rollback timestamp.
- **Git-native alternative:** Use annotated tags instead (`git tag -a ops-2026-01-27-001 -m "<yaml>"`).
