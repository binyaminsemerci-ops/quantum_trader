# ============================================================================
# CHAOS TEST: EXIT SAFETY SYSTEM
# ============================================================================
# This workflow validates the fail-closed behavior of the Emergency Exit System.
#
# WHAT IT TESTS:
# 1. Exit Brain dies → Watchdog detects within 5s
# 2. Watchdog publishes system:panic_close
# 3. Emergency Exit Worker executes panic close
# 4. System ends FLAT (no open positions)
#
# POLICY: No merge to main if this fails. Zero exceptions.
